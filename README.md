# OpenFlam


OpenWham is a FOSS, free, open, libre piece of software that allows you to run your own private stack. It's built on the LibreFlam spec makes heavy use of libjargon. 

You could probably write one yourself, but I think this would be better served by someone else who knows more about how things work and has some experience with Linux in general. The code is available here: (LINK REMOVED)

## Installation

Start by getting the system up and running by cloning this repository. If everything goes well, it should just boot into a text console. You can then type `"./start_whammy"` to start the program and press enter to get started. You may need to reboot for things to actually work though so make sure you have an internet connection before doing anything else!
